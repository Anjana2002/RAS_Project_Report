\section{Results}
\subsection{Uploading result of students}
\begin{figure}
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{upload1.jpeg}
	\caption{Uploading result}
	\label{upload}
\end{figure}
We've effectively incorporated a robust system for uploading student results corresponding to their academic papers in each semester, a visual representation of which can be found in Figure \ref{upload}. This system boasts several key features:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Maximum Mark Validation: If a teacher inadvertently enters marks exceeding the predetermined maximum score for an assessment, a prominent indicator will appear around the input box, clearly signaling the error. In this situation, the system will intelligently prevent submission until the erroneous marks are rectified.
	\item Submission Success Page: Upon successfully uploading and submitting the marks, the system will gracefully transition to a dedicated success message page. This page provides immediate confirmation that the data has been securely saved. Furthermore, it furnishes a 'Next' button, strategically positioned for seamless navigation to the next student, streamlining the grading process with efficiency.
	\item Duplicate Entry Alert: To prevent redundancy and errors, when a teacher inadvertently attempts to upload marks for a student for the second time, a discerning notification will promptly appear. This alert serves as a safeguard, informing the teacher that marks for the specific student have already been successfully uploaded. This redundancy check ensures data integrity and minimizes potential inaccuracies in the grading records.\\

\end{enumerate}
	In summary, our system ensures accuracy, ease of use, and effective data management for the task of uploading and managing student results during each semester, making the entire process a user-friendly and error-free experience.
\subsection{Edit/view result}
In addition to the primary result upload functionality, we have also seamlessly integrated the capability to edit and update student marks, particularly when supplementary or improvement exam results are published by the university. Teachers can easily edit and update student marks. After editing, clicking 'Submit' triggers a successful submission message, along with a 'Next' button for seamless navigation to the next student.
\subsection{Different types of analyses}
We have conducted various types of analysis, including departmental top analysis and semester-wise analysis, student analysis, single subject analysis etc.
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Department Top - In this, users can specify the desired number of top students for each semester, as shown in Figure \ref{dept_top}, for each class. Additionally, we provide a printing option for generating hard copies of the results.
	\item Student Analysis - In student analysis, we can retrieve the marks from multiple semesters of a student at once, and the overall result is obtained only when marks from all semesters are uploaded. Additionally, it offer bar diagram Figure \ref{graph} showing the percentage for each semester, facilitating communication between teachers and students. It also offer a printing option, which we believe is valuable for meetings with parents and other documentation purposes.
	\item Single Subject Analysis - In this, we display students marks for a specific paper. Additionally, we provide a pie chart illustrating the distribution of grades, Figure \ref{pie}.
	\item Semester Wise Analysis - In this, we display the complete results of all students in each semester. Additionally, we provide a separate table that shows the number of grades in each paper. This feature helps identify the number of students who pass and fail.
	\item Advanced Search - In the advanced search feature, you have the flexibility to search for results in various ways.
