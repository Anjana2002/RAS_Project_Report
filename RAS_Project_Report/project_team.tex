This oversight had the potential to significantly distort the subsequent analysis. Recognizing this issue, we promptly addressed it by implementing a code modification. This modification now prevents the addition of marks that exceed the established maximum mark, ensuring the integrity and accuracy of the analysis process.That is when a user attempts to upload a mark above the maximum allowed mark, the system immediately provides a visual indication by highlighting the input box with a distinct red border (Figure\ref{testing}). This ensures that the marks stay within the specified limits and maintains data accuracy.

\chapter{Results and Discussion}
The Result Analysis System is a comprehensive software solution designed to streamline and enhance the academic performance evaluation process within educational institutions. The automation of result analysis has not only reduced manual effort but also improved the quality of evaluations. With consistent and reliable results, educators can make data-informed decisions to enhance the learning experience. The system's ability to conduct various types of analyses, such as departmental top analysis, semester wise analysis etc. and historical data retrieval, offers a deeper understanding of academic performance trends. This information is invaluable for academic planning and decision-making.
\section{Results}
\subsection{Uploading result of students}

We've effectively incorporated a robust system for uploading student results corresponding to their academic papers in each semester, a visual representation of which can be found in Figure \ref{upload}. This system boasts several key features:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Maximum Mark Validation: If a teacher inadvertently enters marks exceeding the predetermined maximum score for an assessment, a prominent indicator will appear around the input box, clearly signaling the error. In this situation, the system will intelligently prevent submission until the erroneous marks are rectified.
	\item Submission Success Page: Upon successfully uploading and submitting the marks, the system will gracefully transition to a dedicated success message page. This page provides immediate confirmation that the data has been securely saved. Furthermore, it furnishes a 'Next' button, strategically positioned for seamless navigation to the next student, streamlining the grading process with efficiency.
	\item Duplicate Entry Alert: To prevent redundancy and errors, when a teacher inadvertently attempts to upload marks for a student for the second time, a discerning notification will promptly appear. This alert serves as a safeguard, informing the teacher that marks for the specific student have already been successfully uploaded. This redundancy check ensures data integrity and minimizes potential inaccuracies in the grading records.\\

We have conducted various types of analysis, including departmental top analysis and semester-wise analysis, student analysis, single subject analysis etc.
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Department Top - In this, users can specify the desired number of top students for each semester, as shown in Figure \ref{dept_top}, for each class. Additionally, we provide a printing option for generating hard copies of the results.

 \begin{figure}[H]

	\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{top.jpeg}
	\caption{Department top searching}
	\label{dept_top}
\end{figure}

	\item Student Analysis - In student analysis, we can retrieve the marks from multiple semesters of a student at once, and the overall result is obtained only when marks from all semesters are uploaded. Additionally, it offer bar diagram Figure \ref{graph} showing the percentage for each semester, facilitating communication between teachers and students. It also offer a printing option, which we believe is valuable for meetings with parents and other documentation purposes.

	\includegraphics[scale=0.35]{bar_diagram.png}
	\caption{Bar diagram of a student based on semesters}
	\label{graph}
\end{figure}
	\item Single Subject Analysis - In this, we display students marks for a specific paper. Additionally, we provide a pie chart illustrating the distribution of grades, Figure \ref{pie}.

	\centering
	\includegraphics[scale=0.4]{pie1.png}
	\caption{Pie chart depicting the distribution of grades for a specific paper.}
	\label{pie}
\end{figure}


	\item Semester Wise Analysis - In this, we display the complete results of all students in each semester. Additionally, we provide a separate table that shows the number of grades in each paper. This feature helps identify the number of students who pass and fail.
	\item Advanced Search - In the advanced search feature, you have the flexibility to search for results in various ways. Semester is a mandatory input, and you can further refine your search using options such as name, registration number, program, year of admission, quota, status (pass or fail), and gender. This enables you to perform diverse searches.
	
	eg: finding all male students who passed in BSc Plant Science and are also sports quota students.
